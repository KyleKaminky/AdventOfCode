# AdventOfCode

This was my first year giving a shot at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge series! If you haven't heard of it, Advent of Code is an awesome yearly programming challenge that is during December leading up to Christmas, like an advent calendar. The challenges start out simple and then get progressively harder each day. Below are some screenshots showing how far I got and also some statistics on how many people solved all the challenges.
